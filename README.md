issues fixed and how

If you are accessing an instance using public ip but if its not loading the webpage (if the security inbound rule allows all traffic) 

try in incognito with http:// ip address


usually the ip address will be https by default


also you can use following checklist


i have an instance i-0ea39a6e0bfa7086b which i am trying to access on web using its public ip, but i am getting 404 the security group allows all traffic

Based on the information you've provided, it seems like you're having trouble accessing your EC2 instance via its public IP address. Even though your security group allows all traffic, there are a few things we should check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Verify that your EC2 instance is actually running. You can check this in the EC2 console or by using the AWS CLI.
2. Double-check your security group settings. Although you mentioned it allows all traffic, it's worth confirming that there are inbound rules specifically allowing HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from source 0.0.0.0/0.
3. Check if the web server on your EC2 instance is running. If it's not, you'll need to start it. The command to do this depends on your operating system and web server software.
4. Verify that your instance is in a public subnet with an Internet Gateway attached to the VPC.
5. Ensure that the public IP address you're using is the current one associated with your instance. EC2 instances can get new public IPs when stopped and started.
6. Try pinging the public IP address from your local system to check if it's reachable.
7. Check the server logs to see if the requests are reaching your server at all.
8. If you're using a custom domain name, make sure it's correctly pointing to your instance's public IP.

If you've verified all these points and are still experiencing issues, it might be helpful to:

* Try accessing the instance using its public DNS name instead of the IP address.
* Check if you can connect to the instance using SSH (assuming you have the necessary permissions and key pair).
* Review the Network Access Control List (NACL) for the subnet where your instance is located to ensure it's not blocking traffic.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to consider launching a new instance to see if the problem persists, which could help isolate whether it's an instance-specific issue or a broader networking problem.
